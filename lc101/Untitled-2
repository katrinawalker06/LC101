	<h1> To start with the life of a foster child you need to first understand what is means to be a Foster Care Case Manager</h1>
	    <p>You might ask, “ what is case managing?” Case managing consist typically of some type of demographic that you are doing front line work in order to help or aid someone through a situation where that be for a short or long term.  I have worked with Domestic violence victims, Homeless teenagers,  mentally ill homeless singles and families, teenage girls and now foster care.  All of these groups have something in common. They are all demographic that has lacked a way to advocate for themselves.  In these situations you have the people not feeling heard and their counterparts(parents,courts and etc) not feeling as though the ones in need are effectively hearing them.</p>
	
    <h2>The beginning and end of a safe place for a child</h2>
        <p>At that time, there are two ways a child can be brought into care.
1. There was a hotline (someone connect to the child’s life contacts the state of Missouri and let them know the concern. If the concern is great enough a Protective Custody Assessment(PCA) is completed.
		a. PCA is a form where all pertinent information is written down( as factual as possible) and submitted at Family Court. 
2.  Another possibility is that the police come across a situation that causes them to feel as thought the children are an immediate danger the police can file a 33 which allows the children to immediately come into to care.</p>
    <h2>Once a child(ren) is/are brought into care</h2>
	   <p> An appropriate home(foster,relative or kinship) is located where the child can go to while more information is gathered. Once the child is in that home the adult has 72  hours to have the child seen by a physician to determine if there are any health issues which could include bruises,broken bones and etc. that can be indicative of physical abuse. During this time the case is assigned to a Foster Care Case Manager. 

        Within 72 business hours the matter is brought before a Commissioner or Judge as a Protective Custody Hearing(PC). At this hearing, is it determined if the reasons why the are brought into care child(ren) brought into care are still present. If they are not then the child(ren )are allowed to return home. If those concerns are still valid then the child(ren) will remain in care .  During this hearing the child(ren) is appointed  an attorney as well as the parents can apply for a free attorney( determined by their monthly income and family size). </p>
        
    <h2>First 90 days of a case</h2>
    
        <p>If the children remain in care there are several things that need to occur between this point and hearing(adjudication). There are meetings every 30 days that the team( parents,child(ren) if of appropriate age, attorneys and any other providers(therapist,teachers and etc). There is a case management hearing the the county of Jackson County,MO where updated information is given usually after 2-3 weeks after the PC hearing. 

During this time there is a hearing to determine if the reasons came into care are valid. This is ascertained at the adjudication. This is the time were all information and events that occurred prior to the child(ren)officially coming into care.</p>
    <h2>After this hearing, there are 3 possible options that can happen:</h2>
    <ul>
The case is substantiated/sustained which means the                   allegations were proved<br></br> The case is unsubstantiated/not sustained which means the allegations were not-proven</br></br>The other options is stipulating this means that the parents are stating that there is enough proof to show this happened and forgo the option of having a trial. 
    </ul>
    <p>In the second possibility if the allegations where not  unsubstantiated/not sustained the children are able to return home. In the other two options the cases moves to disposition is where the next step moving forward in case.  At this time, the case worker is asked to testify as to what has occurred from the day the children came into care of the State till that day.  Any services that were suggested are then court order which at times will determine if they are able to visit with their children or not. 
    </p>
    <h2>Continuous step</h2>
    <p>After the disposition, court is held every 3-6 months to determine if the same issues that brought the child(ren) into care are still present. Depending on the concerns and resolve of the parents directly correlate with  the length of the case.  Eventually, if a case continues on without hope of reunifying it is then determine if there is another permanent option (adoption or guardianship) that would be in the best interest of the children. Cases can last for 6  months to years upon years.

There are numerous providers that give their professional opinions but, it the final decesion on everything is up to the Judge or Commissioner. <p>
